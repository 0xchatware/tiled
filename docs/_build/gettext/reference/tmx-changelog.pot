#: ../../reference/tmx-changelog.rst:33
msgid "The :ref:`tmx-property` element gained a ``type`` attribute, storing the type of the value. Currently supported types are ``string`` (the default), ``int``, ``float`` and ``bool``."

msgid "Tiled 0.15"
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/tmx-changelog.rst:40
msgid "The ``offsetx`` and ``offsety`` attributes are now also used for :ref:`tmx-imagelayer` elements, replacing the ``x`` and ``y`` attributes previously used. This change was made for consistency with the other layer types."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/tmx-changelog.rst:44
msgid "The tiles in an image collection tileset are no longer guaranteed to be consecutive, because removing tiles from the collection will no longer change the IDs of other tiles."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/tmx-changelog.rst:47
msgid "The pure XML and Gzip-compressed tile layer data formats were deprecated, since they didn't have any advantage over other formats. Remaining formats are CSV, base64 and Zlib-compressed layer data."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/tmx-changelog.rst:50
msgid "Added ``columns`` attribute to the :ref:`tmx-tileset` element, which specifies the number of tile columns in the tileset. For image collection tilesets it is editable and is used when displaying the tileset."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/tmx-changelog.rst:54
msgid "The ``backgroundcolor`` attribute of the :ref:`tmx-map` element will now take the format ``#AARRGGBB`` when its alpha value differs from 255. Previously the alpha value was silently discarded."

msgid "Tiled 0.14"
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/tmx-changelog.rst:61
msgid "Added optional ``offsetx`` and ``offsety`` attributes to the ``layer`` and ``objectgroup`` elements. These specify an offset in pixels that is to be applied when rendering the layer. The default values are 0."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/tmx-changelog.rst:67
msgid "Tiled 0.13"
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/tmx-changelog.rst:69
msgid "Added an optional ``tilecount`` attribute to the ``tileset`` element, which is written by Tiled to help parsers determine the amount of memory to allocate for tile data."
msgstr ""

msgid "Tiled 0.12"
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/tmx-changelog.rst:76
msgid "Previously tile objects never had ``width`` and ``height`` properties, though the format technically allowed this. Now these properties are used to store the size the image should be rendered at. The default values for these attributes are the dimensions of the tile image."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/tmx-changelog.rst:83
msgid "Tiled 0.11"
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/tmx-changelog.rst:85
msgid "Added ``hexagonal`` to the supported values for the ``orientation`` attribute on the ``map`` element. This also adds ``staggerindex`` (``even`` or ``odd``) and ``staggeraxis`` (``x`` or ``y``) and ``hexsidelength`` (integer value) attributes to the ``map`` element, in order to support the many variations of staggered hexagonal. The new ``staggerindex`` and ``staggeraxis`` attributes are also supported when using the ``staggered`` map orientation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/tmx-changelog.rst:92
msgid "Added an ``id`` attribute to the ``object`` element, which stores a map-unique ID of the object."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/tmx-changelog.rst:94
msgid "Added a ``nextobjectid`` attribute to the ``map`` element, which stores the next available ID for new objects. This number is stored to prevent reuse of the same ID after objects have been removed."

#: ../../reference/tmx-changelog.rst:99
msgid "Tiled 0.10"
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/tmx-changelog.rst:101
msgid "Tile objects can now be horizontally or vertically flipped. This is stored in the ``gid`` attribute using the same mechanism as for regular tiles. The image is expected to be flipped without affecting its position, same way as flipped tiles."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/tmx-changelog.rst:106
msgid "Objects can be rotated freely. The rotation is stored in degrees as a ``rotation`` attribute, with positive rotation going clockwise."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/tmx-changelog.rst:109
msgid "The render order of the tiles on tile layers can be configured in a number of ways through a new ``renderorder`` property on the ``map`` element. Valid values are ``right-down`` (the default), ``right-up``, ``left-down`` and ``left-up``. In all cases, the map is drawn row-by-row. This is only supported for orthogonal maps at the moment."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/tmx-changelog.rst:115
msgid "The render order of objects on object layers can be configured to be either sorted by their y-coordinate (previous behavior and still the default) or simply the order of appearance in the map file. The latter enables manual control over the drawing order with actions that \"Raise\" and \"Lower\" selected objects. It is controlled by the ``draworder`` property on the ``objectgroup`` element, which can be either ``topdown`` (default) or ``index``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/tmx-changelog.rst:123
msgid "Tiles can have an ``objectgroup`` child element, which can contain objects that define the collision shape to use for that tile. This information can be edited in the new Tile Collision Editor."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/tmx-changelog.rst:127
msgid "Tiles can have a single looping animation associated with them using an ``animation`` child element. Each frame of the animation refers to a local tile ID from this tileset and defines the frame duration in milliseconds. Example:"

msgid "Tiled 0.9"

#: ../../reference/tmx-changelog.rst:154
msgid "Terrain information was added to tileset definitions (this is generally not very relevant for games):"
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/tmx-changelog.rst:168
msgid "There is preliminary support for a \"staggered\" (isometric) projection (new value for the ``orientation`` attribute of the ``map`` element)."

msgid "A basic image layer type was added:"

msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/tmx-changelog.rst:188
msgid "Added map property for specifying the background color:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/tmx-changelog.rst:194
msgid "Added initial (non-GUI) support for individual and/or embedded tile images (since there is no way to set this up in Tiled Qt but only in Tiled Java or with `pytmxlib <https://github.com/encukou/pytmxlib>`__, this is not very important to support at the moment):"

#: ../../reference/tmx-changelog.rst:224
msgid "Tilesets now support defining a drawing offset in pixels, which is to be used when drawing any tiles from that tileset. Example:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference/tmx-changelog.rst:234
msgid "Support for tile rotation in 90-degree increments was added by using the third most significant bit in the global tile id. This new bit means \"anti-diagonal flip\", which swaps the x and y axis when rendering a tile."

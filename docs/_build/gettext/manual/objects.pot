msgid "Working with Objects"

#: ../../manual/objects.rst:4
msgid "Using objects you can add a great deal of information to your map for use in your game. They can replace tedious alternatives like hardcoding coordinates (like spawn points) in your source code or maintaining additional data files for storing gameplay elements. With the addition of *tile objects*, they also became useful for graphical purposes and can in some cases replace tile layers entirely, as demonstrated by the \"Sticker Knight\" example shipping with Tiled."

msgid "Shortcut: ``R``"
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/objects.rst:25
msgid "The rectangle was the first type of object supported by Tiled, which is why objects are rectangles by default in the :doc:`/reference/tmx-map-format`. They are useful for marking rectangular areas and assigning custom properties to them. They are also often used for specifying collision boxes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/objects.rst:30
msgid "Place a rectangle by clicking-and-dragging in any direction. Holding ``Shift`` makes it square and holding ``Ctrl`` snaps its size to the tile size."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/objects.rst:34
msgid "If the rectangle is empty (width and height are both 0), it is rendered as a small square around its position. This is mainly to keep it visible and selectable. Empty rectangles can be used for placing point objects, at least as long as no explicit support for point objects is available (`#1325 <https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/issues/1325>`__)."

msgid "Polygons are the most flexible way of defining the shape of an area. They are most commonly used for defining collision shapes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../manual/objects.rst:57
msgid "When placing a polygon, the first click determines the location of the object as well as the location of the first point of the polygon. Subsequent clicks are used to add additional points to the polygon. Right click or press ``Enter`` to finish creating the polygon. Polygons needs to have at least three points. You can press ``Escape`` to cancel the creation of the polygon."

msgid "Tiles can be inserted as objects to have full flexibility in placing, scaling and rotating the tile image on your map. Like all objects, tile objects can also have custom properties associated with them. This makes them useful for placement of recognizable interactive objects that need special information, like a chest with defined contents or an NPC with defined script."

msgid "By default you interact with the top-most object. When you need to select an object below another object, first select the higher object and then hold ``Alt`` while clicking at the same location to select lower objects.

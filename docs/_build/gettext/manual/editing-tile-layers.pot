msgid ":ref:`tile-layer-introduction` are what makes Tiled a *tile map editor*. Although not as flexible as :ref:`object-layer-introduction`, they provide efficient data storage and good rendering performance as well as efficient content creation. Every new map gets one by default, though feel free to delete it when you're not going to use it."

msgid "The primary tool for editing tile layers is the Stamp Brush. It can be used to paint single tiles as well as larger \"stamps\", which is where it gets its name from. Using the right mouse button, it can also quickly capture tile stamps from the currently active layer. A tile stamp is commonly created by selecting one or more tiles in the Tilesets view."

msgid "Activate the *Random Mode* using the dice button on the tool bar to have the Stamp Brush paint with random tiles from the tile stamp. The probability of each tile depends on how often it occurred on the tile stamp, as well as the probability set on each tile in the *Tileset Editor*."

msgid "In combination with the *Tile Stamps* view, it can also place randomly from a set of predefined tile stamps. This can be more useful than the *Random Mode*, which randomly places individual tiles."

msgid "Similarly to the `Stamp Brush <#stamp-brush>`__, you can draw lines by holding ``Shift``. When holding ``Ctrl``, the size of the editing area is reduced to one corner (this currently doesn't work well in combination with drawing lines)."

msgid "When holding ``Alt``, the editing operations are also applied at a 180 degree rotation. This is especially useful when editing strategic maps where two sides need to have equal opportunities. The modifier works well in combination with either ``Shift`` for drawing lines or ``Ctrl`` for reducing the edited area."
